> human problem solving, from the most blundering to the most insightful, involves nothing more than varying mixtures of trial and error and selectivity. 

> [!quote|red]+ Highlight ([page. 206](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L6PT7NKH?page=206&annotation=63CLQ9XX))
> selectivity derives from various rules of thumb, or heuristics, that suggest which paths should be tried first and which leads are promising.

> - **We should design without final goals because the exposure to design and new experiences can generate new goals and activity. "Each step of implementation created a new situation; and the new situation provided starting point for fresh design activity." Instead of thinking final goal, we can think of starting point as the destination of designing. "The real result of our actions is to establish initial conditions for the next succeeding stage of action. What we call "final" goals are in fact criteria for choosing the initial conditions that we will leave to our successors."**

> Making complex designs that are implemented over a long period of time and continually modified in the course of implementation has much in common with painting in oil. In oil painting every new spot of pigment laid on the canvas creates some kind of pattern that provides a continuing source of new ideas to the painter. The painting process is a process of cyclical interaction between painter and canvas in which current goals lead to new applications of paint, while the gradually changing pattern suggests new goals.

Data for planning. Methods of forecasting, the use of prediction and feedback in control. 3. Identifying the client. Professional-client relations, society as the client, the client as player in a game. 4. Organizations in social design. Not only is social design carried out mainly by people working in organizations, but an important goal of the design is to fashion and change social organization in general and individual organizations in particular. 5. Time and space horizons. The discounting of time, defining progress, managing attention. 6. Designing without final goals. Designing for future flexibility, design activity as goal, designing an evolving system.
